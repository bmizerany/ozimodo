1.1.1:
  - Adding a 'component' field to tumble.yml to let you specify which 
    component directory houses your tumblelog.
  - Fixed bug in default quote type rendering.
  - Moved stylesheets into your_tumblelog component (and made them erbish)
  - Fixed a lot of caching logic, renamed some related methods
  - Added method_missing to main TumbleController -- send unknown requests
    down the pipe to allow for easier adding of custom component actions
